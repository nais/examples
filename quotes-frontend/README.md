# Quotes Frontend Application

This is an example project used to showcase functionality in the [Nais platform](https://nais.io). The application demonstrates how to build and deploy a modern web application with features like structured logging, in-memory data storage, and UUID-based routing. It interacts with the [quotes-backend](../quotes-backend/) service for persistent quote management.

## Features

- **Random Quote Display**: View a random quote on the homepage.
- **Submit New Quotes**: Add new quotes via a user-friendly form.
- **Shareable Links**: Each quote has a unique URL for sharing.
- **Structured Logging**: Uses `pino` for structured logging in both development and production environments.
- **Backend Integration**: Fetches and submits quotes to the [quotes-backend](../quotes-backend/) API for persistence.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) for server-side rendering and routing.
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety and modern JavaScript features.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
- **Logging**: `pino` for structured and efficient logging.
- **UUIDs**: `uuid` library for generating unique identifiers.
- **API**: RESTful API routes built with Next.js and integration with the quotes-backend service.
## Backend API (quotes-backend)

The frontend communicates with the [quotes-backend](../quotes-backend/) service for all quote data. Ensure the backend is running (see its README for setup instructions).

### Main Endpoints

- `GET /api/quotes`: Retrieve all quotes.
- `POST /api/quotes`: Add a new quote. The backend generates the `id`.
- `GET /api/quotes/{id}`: Retrieve a quote by its ID.

#### Example: Add a Quote

Request:

```json
{
  "text": "Your quote here",
  "author": "Author Name"
}
```

Response (201 Created):

```json
{
  "id": "6",
  "text": "Your quote here",
  "author": "Author Name"
}
```

#### Error Handling

If required fields are missing or the request body is invalid, the backend returns:

```json
{
  "error": "BAD_REQUEST",
  "message": "Failed to convert request body to class io.nais.quotesbackend.Quote"
}
```

#### Health Check

- `GET /internal/health`: Returns `200 OK` and `Application is healthy` if the backend is running.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v22 or later)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nais/examples/quotes-frontend.git
   cd quotes-frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Development Server

Start the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

### Building for Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
yarn build
```

Start the production server:

```bash
yarn start
```

### Testing

Run tests:

```bash
yarn test
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory to configure environment variables:

```
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
# Optionally, set the backend API URL if not running on localhost:
# QUOTES_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

## Logging

The application uses `pino` for structured logging. Logs are formatted differently for development and production environments:

- **Development**: Pretty-printed logs with `pino-pretty`.
- **Production**: JSON-formatted logs.
